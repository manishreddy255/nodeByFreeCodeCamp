const sayHai = (name) => {
  console.log(`Hello There ${name}`);
};

// export default
module.exports = sayHai;

// i will write the chronology of using the module here

// so every file is module, so module is  a boject
// and it has export which can be accessed by all the files
// and to access it we use require and mention the file path in it
