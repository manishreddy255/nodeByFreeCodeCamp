This is about node
It is a server development environment 
It is based on v8 engine which is based on javascript

so in node we have modules 
every file is a module

so we have a object called "module"
in that we have "exports" and that is used to send data across files
That exported data is imported into a module using "require"

and use it in the app

And how we import is, "when we require the file the file gets executed and if somthing
is imported it is placed in exports"


And there are many modules in node which are inbuilt

that is 
*os
*path
*file system
*http
