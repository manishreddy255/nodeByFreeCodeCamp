// now let's create servers with the fundamental knowledge we gained

/* 
before that we'll know how the web works so that we will have a clearer understanding of what's going on
every website have a server 
in this we have something and we try to request something
and the browser sends a request to the server about it
and the server validates and send a response

That request response is done by http protocol 
so that's why these are called "HTTP messages" that we send 
user sends "HTTP request messages" and 
server sends "HTTP response" messages
and that's how we exchange data on web
